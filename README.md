### Introduction Our Solution

- By using our app, users can identify the type of trash they need to dispose of through AI, as well as locate nearby garbage cans
- This will enable them to properly dispose of their waste, contributing to the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals of Sustainable Cities and Communities, Clean Water and Sanitation, and ultimately creating a cleaner environment for everyone.

### Architecture

- Our app was developed with a flutter on the front end, and we used firebase for authentication/authorization, and google map to locate the trash can. The backend developed a server with a spring boot and distributed it through CloudRun, and the AI model was made into tensorflow and distributed through the compute engine.

2. **When  press the camera button to see what trash I'm trying to throw away, then AI tells me the type of trash and recommends a nearby garbage can.**

3. **When you click on the recommended garbage can, its location will be marked on the map with a red marker.**

4. **When the user arrives at the recommended garbage can and disposes of the plastic trash, they will receive a plastic item card as a reward.**

5. **If the garbage can is full, users can report its status to the local government through the "Report" button.**
